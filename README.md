## Introduction

Welcome to my Data Science and Research Projects Portfolio! This repository showcases various projects that I've worked on, mainly regarding Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Visualization, Machine Learning and Economics and Behavioral Science research.

## Projects

### Python Assignments

#### Coursera EDA

- **Description**: This project involves using data visualizations to explore the features of Coursera courses data and to test if there are meaningful relationships between the variables found in the dataset.
- **Files**: The `python_assignments/Coursera_EDA` folder contains all the relevant files for this project.

#### Spotify Top 50 Analysis

- **Description**: This project analyzes the top 50 songs on Spotify using various data science techniques.
- **Files**: The `Spotify_Top_50_Analysis` folder contains all the relevant files for this analysis.

#### Calculator Package

- **Description**: This package provides a simple calculator class that performs operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, nth root calculation, and the ability to reset the calculator's state.
- **Files**: The `CalculatorPackage` folder contains all the relevant files for this package.

### Contract Parser

- **Description**: This project contains a script for parsing information of collective labor contracts (CCT) in Mexico from official website URLS. The extracted data is saved to Excel tables. The script uses Selenium for web scraping and BeautifulSoup for parsing the HTML content.
- **Files**: The `web_scraping/contract_parser` folder contains all the relevant files for this project.

### Shiny App

- **Description**: This directory contains an R Shiny app that provides graphical tools to understand the crisis of violence related to organized crime in Mexico over the past two decades.
- **Live App**: [Shiny App on shinyapps.io](https://mao-zen.shinyapps.io/Shiny_SS/) It's a bit heavy, so wait about six seconds for all graphs to load correctly. 
- **Files**: The `shiny_app` folder contains all the relevant files for the Shiny app.

### Research Presentations

- **Description**: This section contains presentations of economics papers and my own research.
- **Files**: The `research_presentations` folder contains all the relevant files for these presentations.

### Discrete Choice Model Estimation

- **Description**: This project includes files related to the estimation of discrete choice models, demonstrating techniques used in econometrics.
- **Files**: The `Discrete_choice_model_estimation` folder contains all the relevant files for this analysis.
