## Introduction

In this notebook, we will use data visualizations to explore the features of Coursera courses data and to test if there are meaningful relationships between the variables found in the dataset.

## Data Cleaning

### Checking for Missing Values

We start by checking for missing values in the dataset to ensure data completeness.

### Checking for Duplicates and Similar Strings

We check for duplicate entries and similar strings to ensure data quality.

### Standardizing Data Types

We standardize data types, such as converting strings to numeric values and coding categorical variables for further analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Distribution and Characteristics of Columns

We examine the general trends and distribution of each feature in the dataset.

### Relationships Between Variables

We explore potential associations between different variables in the dataset using various visualizations.

## Further Research

1. Build regression models with controls to determine the sole effects that variables have on each other.
2. Determine if enrollment distribution is truly scale-free by finding its corresponding parameters.
3. Study more relations between variables, such as organization and levels of difficulty or certificate types.
4. Categorize courses by subject and investigate relations between subject and the rest of the variables.
